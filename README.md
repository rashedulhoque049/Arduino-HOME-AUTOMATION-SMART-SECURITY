Description:

There is an increasing demand for smart homes, where appliances can be easily controlled through one common device. 

Home automation system (HAS) involves introducing a degree of automatic control to certain electrical and electronics system.

The client modules(lights, Fans, Ac, other peripheral devices) communicate with host controllers through a wireless device such as 
a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone, in this case, an android based smart phone.

The basic idea is:
            
- Fingerprint Lock for Door

- Control with Android App

- App controlled On & OFF switch (Lights, Fans, other peripheral devices) that is going to operate wirelessly via Bluetooth.

- Security Alarm if it detects
                    
     Fire
     Smoke
     Gas
     Air Pollution
